# React Farkle Game

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/robballou/react-farkle.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/robballou/react-farkle)

Using as my tutorial for learning React. [Find out more about Farkle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farkle).

Currently has:

* Some [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) structure
* Some [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) testing for scoring mechanisms

## Install

1. Clone it.
1. `nvm use` (if you're using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)).
2. `npm install` it.
3. `npm run webpack` it.

Currently just opening the `index.html` file directly in a browser, but would be
simple to include a Docker compose setup for that.
